Hello!
------
You are probably here to see some of my past coding projects.  Here are a few:

* [Tscheme](http://github.com/polasek/tscheme): A static code analyzer to help
  find bugs in Scheme code using type constraints and unification.  With Aaron
  Graham-Horowitz and Jan Pol&aacute;&scaron;ek.
* [Regex-combinator](http://github.com/bzinberg/regex-combinator): A clean,
  combinator-based language that compiles to POSIX regular expressions.  This
  is more useful than you might think, see the readme.
* _Anagrams with Fiends_: A web-based implementation of the game Anagrams,
  similar to Bananagrams except that you are allowed to steal words of your
  opponents to build new words.  Implemented using Rails and websockets.  With
  Damien Jiang, Bethany LaPenta and Leon Zhou, 2013.  (Do not yet have
  permission from other team members to publish.)
* _Guichat_: A chat client and server written in Java, supporting chat rooms
  and peer-to-peer messages, tabbed room display, and chat history.  The client
  uses a Swing GUI.  With Akashnil Dutta and Vinay Mayar, 2012.  (Do not yet
  have permission from other team members to publish.)
